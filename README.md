## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for an example Bukkit plugin made to
showcase the [Croissant library](https://github.com/OverMighty/croissant). The
source code contains comments to help Bukkit plugin developers understand how to
use Croissant and to help them get started with it.

Features of both the command framework and the GUI framework of Croissant are
demonstrated with example commands.

The plugin supports Bukkit/Spigot/Paper 1.8.x to 1.14.x.

## Building

**JDK 8 or later is required.**

The example plugin uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and a Gradle wrapper is
included in this repository.

The following command can be run on Unix-like systems to build the plugin
using the Gradle wrapper included in this repository:

```
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

On Windows, the `gradlew.bat` batch script can be used instead of the `gradlew`
POSIX shell script.
